## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Frontend assets and Vite

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to compile frontend assets such as Tailwind CSS utilities and JavaScript modules. Vite does not download stylesheets from the internet at build time. Instead, it reads the configuration in `package.json`, installs the declared dependencies into `node_modules` via `npm install`, and then bundles everything locally:

1. **Install dependencies** – run `npm install` once. The command pulls published packages from the npm registry (the same place most Node.js packages live) and stores them in the `node_modules` folder inside the repository root. Nothing is fetched dynamically when you later run the dev server.
2. **Compile assets** – start the watcher with `npm run dev` (or build for production with `npm run build`). Vite looks at `resources/css/app.css`, `resources/js/app.js`, and any files they import, processes them with Tailwind/PostCSS according to `tailwind.config.js`, and emits the compiled assets into the `public` directory.
3. **Serve in Blade** – Laravel's Blade layout pulls in the generated files through the `@vite` directive. When you run `php artisan serve` alongside `npm run dev`, the dev server injects the processed CSS/JS into the page.

If you do not see the expected colors locally, make sure the above steps have completed successfully. In particular, ensure that `npm install` finished without errors so Tailwind and its plugins are present, and that the Vite dev server (or `npm run build`) has generated the CSS before reloading the page.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
